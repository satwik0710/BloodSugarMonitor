# BloodSugarMonitor
A non-invasive wearable blood sugar monitoring system using sensors and machine learning. This project focuses on designing a cost-effective prototype that can help individuals continuously monitor their glucose trends using optical and bio-signal methods.


## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on designing a **non-invasive blood sugar (glucose) monitoring system** using various physiological sensor inputs. Instead of drawing blood, the system uses optical and bio-signal methods to estimate glucose levels.

The aim is to build a cost-effective prototype that can help individuals continuously monitor their glucose trends.

## 🎯 Key Features

- **Non-invasive monitoring** using PPG (photoplethysmography) sensors
- **Real-time data collection** from multiple physiological sensors
- **Machine Learning model** for glucose level prediction
- **Cost-effective hardware** using Arduino and accessible components
- **Continuous monitoring** capability

## 🛠️ Hardware Used

- **MAX30102** - PPG (Photoplethysmography) Sensor
- **GSR Sensor** - Galvanic Skin Response
- **NTC Thermistor** - Temperature Sensor
- **Arduino Nano/ESP32** - Microcontroller
- **Supporting components** - Resistors, Capacitors, PCB
